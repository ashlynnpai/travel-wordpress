Description: This is a Wordpress theme made with Bootstrap v3.2.0.
Tags: right-sidebar, front-page, responsive
Passed the Google mobile-friendly test (April 9, 2015)

This theme currently requires a little HTML and CSS to change the photos and write the content for the three column section on the front page, as these changes currently cannot be made through the dashboard.
